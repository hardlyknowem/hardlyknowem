- 👋 Hi there! I'm Emma Lefavor.
- 🏢 I sell my labor as a software developer, currently to an early-stage startup supported by [numo](https://www.numo.com/). My current project is called Markup; we're a collaborative editing platform for legal and regulatory documents.
- 🐍 My first love was Python, but lately I've slowly come to appreciate Golang.
- 👵 I've been writing code professionally for ten years now; I still feel like I'm learning every day.
- ✨ still looking for a real-world opportunity to build something in haskell ✨
- ☠️💖 when I'm not working I rap and make music under the name [Emma Cadence](https://soundcloud.com/hardlyknowem) 💖☠️
