- 👋 Hi there! I'm Emma Lefavor.
- 🏢 I sell my labor as a Staff Software Engineer at [Pilot](https://pilot.com/), where we do bookkeeping services at scale.
- 🐍 My first love was Python, though I've had a very passionate liaison with Typescript on the side for a while now. I have begrudgingly learned to appreciate Golang, C#, and even (some flavors of) Java over the years, but I'm happy to mostly be writing Python again.
- 👵 I've been writing code professionally for ten years now; I still feel like I'm learning every day.
- ✨ still looking for a real-world opportunity to build something in haskell! ✨
- ☠️💖 when I'm not working I rap and make music under the name [Emma Cadence](https://soundcloud.com/hardlyknowem). 💖☠️
